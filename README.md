> Why stop at [`Bool.toggle`](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-se-199-add-toggle-to-bool/10681) when you can go so much further?

<br>

## Introducing

- `Date.isMyBirthday`
- `String.isFacepalm`
- `Color.isHappy`
- `Color.isSad`
- `URL.isRickRoll`
- `Int.is42`
- `Int.makeCool`
- `Int.makeAwesome`

## Install
- Copy the file into your project

## Usage
This is a bit difficult, so bear with me:
1. You have to move the cursor to the end of the variable on which you want to use one of our fancy new extensions
2. Depending on the extension you want to use, you now have to press - individually one after another - the keys on your keyboard that have the letters of the extension printed on them

## License
seriously?
